      ðŸ”¹ 44% â€“ Pre-Sale & Staking Rewards
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Master Number 44 | The Generator</strong>
      <br />
      The foundation. The pulse. The movement. This is where energy begins.
      Where participation is rewarded. Where those who stake belief, receive
      value.
      <br />
      Why 44? Because our founder is a 4N Generator. And four means: Structure.
      Strength. Stability. Spirit. Double four means: It's unshakable.
